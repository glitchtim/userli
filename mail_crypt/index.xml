      <description>&lt;p&gt;Legacy users (without MailCrypt keys) continue to work without mailbox
encryption. If they generate a recovery token manually in the account settings,
a MailCrypt key pair gets created for them. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t enable MailCrypt for
them automatically, though. Reason is that this would result in acounts with
partially unencrypted (the old) and partially encrypted (the new) mails.
Therefore we decided to leave the exercise to enable MailCrypt for legacy
users who got a MailCrypt key pair generated in the meantime to the system
admins (e.g. by a cron script).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We use elliptic curve keys with curve secp521r1. The private key is encrypted with a libargon2i hash of the users&#39; password, stored in a libsodium secret box.
A second copy of the private key is stored encrypted with a libargon2i hash of the users&#39; recovery token, to be used when a user restores their account after they lost their password.</description>
